- Fix a bug in rendering Vias
Bug: Previous code uses Via Drill Size to render the via, which causes vias to render smaller than actual size.
Solution: Calulate Via diameter and use it for rendering.
Update stamp: V5.1D20161227 (this can be used to locate the updated/added code)
Note: When via Diameter is set to auto in Eagle, the Diameter is removed from the .brd file, so we need to calculate it from Drill size.

- Implement board mirror feature
