Version 5.3
**************************************************
Auther: Ameen Nihad

- Support for Curves in boarder dimension and signal wires is added, in V5.2 this feature was limited board dimension and to +/-90 degrees.
- Support for slots and inner dimensions is added.
- Support for Panelizing is added, multiple boards or multiple copies of same board can be placed in single .brd file then imported to widget.
- Fixed a bug in curves with angle > 180
- Fixed a bug in dimension milling which caused a gap between plung and retract positions.
- Fixed a bug in drill holes of vias not being mirrored correctly.
- Fixed a bug in posision of dimensions within an elements, previously dimensions were taken from packages without considering element location.
- Optimized how board boundries are caclulated
- Optimized draw3dDimension function - use clipDimensions not wires
- Gcode comments with M6 - Issue #17
- Function draw3dSignalPoly updated to support curved polygons
- A new feature added to avoid tracing board dimensions, this will eliminate job time.
- A new feature added to correct paths orientation, to give the user a choice to do coventional or climb milling.
- TODO: Expose curve resolution to UI - Done but require auto refresh
- TODO: Warning about unmilled slots.
- TODO: Tabs (boarder holders)
- TODO: Fix a bug in render buttom
- TODO: Mill empty areas

Versoin 5.2
**************************************************
Auther: Ameen Nihad

- Changed how holes are handled, now holes for Pads, Vias, packages and Plains are treated exactly the same.
- Now holes are either drilled or milled, that depending on diameter of tools used, i.e. values of:
    - Maximum hole diameter to drill
    - Diameter of tool for cutting dimension
- Fix the bug of "Board dimensions rendered incorrectly", Eagle don't care about order of wires and previous code assumes they are in right order,
  bug fixed by sorting the wires and correct their direction.
- Support for Curves in board dimensions is added.

Update stamp: V5.2D20170105 (this can be used to locate the updated/added code)

Versoin 5.1
**************************************************
Auther: Ameen Nihad

- Fix a bug in rendering Vias
Bug: Previous code uses Via Drill Size to render the via, which causes vias to render smaller than actual size.
Solution: Calulate Via diameter and use it for rendering.
Update stamp: V5.1D20161227 (this can be used to locate the updated/added code)
Note: When via Diameter is set to auto in Eagle, the Diameter is removed from the .brd file, so we need to calculate it from Drill size.

- Implement board mirror feature
Update stamp: V5.1D20161229 (this can be used to locate the updated/added code)
