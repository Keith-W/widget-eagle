- Changed how holes are handled, holes for Pads, Vias and Plains are treated exactly the same.
- Holes are either drilled or milled, that depending on diameter of tools used, i.e. values of:
    - Maximum hole diameter to drill
    - Diameter of tool for cutting dimension
- Fix the bug of "Board dimensions rendered incorrectly", Eagle don't care about order of wires and previous code assumes they are in right order,
  bug fixed by sorting the wires and correct their direction.
- TODO: Curves in board dimensions.

- Fix a bug in rendering Vias
Bug: Previous code uses Via Drill Size to render the via, which causes vias to render smaller than actual size.
Solution: Calulate Via diameter and use it for rendering.
Update stamp: V5.1D20161227 (this can be used to locate the updated/added code)
Note: When via Diameter is set to auto in Eagle, the Diameter is removed from the .brd file, so we need to calculate it from Drill size.

- Implement board mirror feature
